You are a senior AI systems architect advising on technology choices for a high-scale web application. Use step-by-step Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to select the most appropriate **database type** for the following project. Do not jump to a conclusion immediatelyâ€”carefully consider the pros and cons of various database models and match them to each specific requirement. Conclude with a well-justified recommendation and mention a specific database product as an example.

**Application Requirements:**
- A social media platform targeting **millions of users**
- Must store: **user profiles**, **posts**, and **user-to-user relationships (connections)**
- Anticipated **80% read / 20% write operation ratio**
- **Low latency on reads** is critical
- Needs to be **scalable** to support rapid user base growth

Think out loud. Start from the requirements and work through the decision process clearly.
