You are an expert AI tasked with reviewing a JavaScript function from the perspective of three different professional roles. Analyze the given code through the lens of each role described below. For each role, provide specific, actionable feedbackâ€”not just general comments. Be thorough, but keep the language natural and developer-friendly.

**Roles and Focus Areas:**

1. **Experienced Developer**:
   - Assess code readability, maintainability, and use of modern JavaScript practices.
   - Suggest design or structural improvements.

2. **Security Engineer**:
   - Identify any security vulnerabilities or poor practices (e.g., improper handling of user input, logging sensitive data).
   - Suggest mitigation strategies where needed.

3. **Performance Specialist**:
   - Evaluate the efficiency and scalability of the function.
   - Recommend optimizations, especially for larger datasets.

**Code to Review:**
```javascript
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
